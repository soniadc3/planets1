Mars is very cold and desert like, but it's a nice color.
There are two moons!
Some people might like the lack of humidity, I suppose.   
We want to consider Venus as a base instead! Cool spaceships can float in its atmosphere. Might be a bit dangerous though...

Only cool kids go to Mars.

HELLO SONIA DO U THINK U WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND MARS ON GEOFINDER??
